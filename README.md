============

**Features**

* Identifies databases with password protection and displays the password
* Identifies the version of Access used to create the database
* Identifies the build number of the version of Access used to create the database

* Output database stats as YAML
* Seek other db 'stats' to output
* De-crypt the RC4 portion of the DB definition page
* Make generic to other Jet Databases if possible
* Increment Access DB version, 8.0 (2000) = 9.0 (2000) etc. Seek further documentation.
